        <p>Q: How do you ensure allergen safety in your processing?</p>
        <p>A: We take allergen safety very seriously. All our products are processed in a facility that handles various

            However, we cannot guarantee the complete absence of allergens.</p>

        <h3>Missed Deliveries</h3>
        <p>Q: What happens if I miss my delivery?</p>
        <p>A: If you miss your delivery, the courier will leave a notice with instructions on how to reschedule or
            collect your package from a nearby location.</p>
